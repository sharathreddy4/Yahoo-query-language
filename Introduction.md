#**INTRODUCTION**
##**What isYQL?**
- The Yahoo! Query Language (YQL) Web Service enables us to access Internet data with SQL-like commands. YQL helps software developers to develop Web applications that call Web services to retrieve data in XML or JSON format. 
- The basic syntax of YQL is similar to SQL.

- The basic YQL syntax is:
SELECT what FROM source WHEREconditions

- When it processes a query, the YQL Web Service accesses a datasource on the Internet,   transforms the data, and returns the results in either XML or JSON format. 
- YQL can access  several types of datasources, including Yahoo Web Services, other Web services, and Web  content in formats such as HTML, XML, RSS, and Atom.
