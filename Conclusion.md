#**CONCLUSION**
- YQL is used because of its various advantages which are as follows:
- Because it resembles SQL, the syntax of YQL is already familiar to many developers. YQL hides the complexity of Web service APIs by presenting data as simple tables, rows, and columns.
- YQL includes pre-defined tables for popular Yahoo Web services such as Flickr, Social, MyBlogLog, and Search.
- YQL can access services on the Internet that output data in the following formats: HTML, XML, JSON, RSS, Atom, and microformat.
- YQL is extensible, allowing you to define Open Data Tables to access datasources other than Yahoo Web Services. This feature enables you to mash up (combine) data from multiple Web services and APIs, exposing the data as a single YQL table.
- You can choose either XML or JSON for the format of the results returned by requests to YQL.
- YQL sub-selects enable you to join data from disparate datasources on the Web. YQL returns the data in a structured document, with elements that resemble rows in a table.
- With YQL, you can filter the data returned with an expression that is similar to the WHERE clause of SQL.
- When processing data from large tables, you can page through the query results.
- The YQL Console enables you to run YQL statements interactively from your browser.
